/*
Tic-tac-toe: https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

- Pubkey has a length of 32 bytes so 2 * 32 = 64
- u8 as a vector has a length of 1
- The board has a length of (9 * (1 + 1)). We know the board has 9 tiles (-> 9) of type Option which borsh serializes with 1 byte
	(set to 1 for Some and 0 for None) plus the size of whatever's in the Option.
	In this case, it's a simple enum with types that don't hold more types so the maximum size of the enum is also just 1
	(for its discriminant). In total that means we get 9 (tiles) * (1 (Option) + 1(Sign discriminant)).
- State is also an enum so we need 1 byte for the discriminant.
	We have to init the account with the maximum size and the maximum size of an enum is the size of its biggest variant.
	In this case that's the winner variant which holds a Pubkey.
	A Pubkey is 32 bytes long so the size of state is 1 (discriminant) + 32 (winner pubkey)
	(MAXIMUM_SIZE is a const variable so specifying it in terms of a sum of the sizes of Game's members' fields does not incur any runtime cost).
